### Introduction

The Virtual Experience program provided by Accenture through Forage offers a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in data analysis. The program focuses on completing the Data Analysis Life Cycle and provides insights into the role of a Data Analyst.

### Program Overview

In this assignment, participants are immersed in a virtual environment where they work as Data Analysts at Accenture. Participants form part of a larger team with diverse roles and responsibilities. The team is assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz, presenting an exciting opportunity to showcase data analysis and visualization skills.

### Assignment Description

The objective of the assignment is to analyze the content categories of Social Buzz and identify the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity, along with a few other questions. The assignment requires participants to perform various data analysis tasks using the provided dataset.

### Key Responsibilities

As a Data Analyst in this assignment, the following responsibilities were undertaken:

•Requirements Gathering: Understand the business question, which is to determine the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

•Data Cleaning: For three datasets (Reaction, Reaction Type, and Content) provided- clean the data by removing rows with missing values, changing data types if necessary, and removing irrelevant columns.

•Data Modeling: Merge the three cleaned datasets together to create a final dataset. Begin with the Reaction table as the base table and join the relevant columns from the Content dataset and the Reaction Type dataset.

•Perform Data Analysis: Calculate the total scores for each category in the final dataset. Identify the top 5 categories based on the highest scores.

### Tools and Techniques Used

To accomplish the assigned tasks, the following tools and techniques were employed:

•	Jupyter Notebook: Python-based interactive environment used for data analysis and documentation.

•	Pandas Library: Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and modeling.

•	Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were used to create visualizations for data analysis.

### Project Execution

The execution of the assignment involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks using the Jupyter Notebook in Python. The relevant datasets were analyzed, cleaned, and modeled to derive meaningful insights. The analysis included determining the number of unique categories, identifying the month with the highest user engagement, and investigating the number of user engagements for each category.

### Conclusion

The Accenture Data Analysis assignment provided a comprehensive understanding of the role and responsibilities of a Data Analyst. The assignment required utilizing various data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. Through the application of Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, insights were derived from the provided dataset. The assignment culminated in the preparation of slides and the presentation of the analysis to the clients.
Overall, the Virtual Experience program offered a valuable opportunity to simulate an end-to-end data analysis project. It provides an in-depth understanding of the data analysis process and showcases the skills necessary for successful data analysis in a professional setting.
